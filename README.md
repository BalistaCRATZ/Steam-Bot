# Steam-Bot
A bot, designed with the beautiful soup library in python, to web scrape the steam market and return affordable items.

In my specific case, I wanted to be notified of any cheap M4A4 skins available on the CS:GO community market. The bot scrapes the website every 10 seconds, and sends a text message to my phone if any skins are found (using the Twilio library).
